# Please help a friend go through college!
Hey everyone!

I have a friend, who I hold dearly, going to school full-time without support from the government and has to take on extra shifts. The federal government has cut back on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) and student loans are arriving late. As the result, she is struggling to study.

I would like to keep her safe from catching COVID at her workplace and at the college.

She will need:
- $5,017 CAD for tuition and student fees
- $2,400 CAD for a laptop
- $800 CAD for books and supplies
- $500 CAD for tutoring
- $200 CAD for community events
- $180 CAD teaching program subscription
- $84.80 CAD monthly bus pass


She will also need help paying rent, but didn't disclose her living costs.

Here is her PayPal: [paypal.me/bglamours](https://paypal.me/bglamours).

Thank you very much!
